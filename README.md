**Task Description for Prodigy Infotech Internship:-**

**Objective:-** Develop a password complexity checker using Python programming language. 
                The tool will assess the strength of a password based on defined criteria and provide feedback to users.

**Features:-**

**Password Length:-**

The program checks if the password meets the defined length criteria.
**Presence of Uppercase Letters:-**

The program verifies the presence of uppercase letters in the given password.

**Presence of Lowercase Letters:-**

The program verifies the presence of lowercase letters in the given password.

**Presence of Special Characters:-**

The program checks for the presence of special characters as defined in the program.

**Presence of Numbers:-**

The program checks for the presence of numbers (0-9) in the given password.

**Output:-**

The program calculates a score based on the number of criteria met by the password.

**Based on the generated score, the strength of the password is displayed as follows:-**

* Score = 5: "Very Strong"
* Score = 4: "Strong"
* Score = 3: "Medium"
* Score = 2: "Weak"
* Score < 2: "Very Weak"
